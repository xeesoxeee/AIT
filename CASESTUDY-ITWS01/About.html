      <h2>History of UPAIT</h2>
        <p class ="pangjustify pangindent">The establishment of the UP Asian Institute of Tourism (AIT) was a long-cherished dream of the tourism industry. As far back as 1973, discussions among tourism agencies had already been in place for the creation of an academic institution focusing on tourism. This was followed by a tripartite agreement among the Department of Tourism, the Philippine Tourism Authority (now reorganized as the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority) and the University of the Philippines.</p>
            <br/>
        <p class ="pangjustify pangindent">In February 26, 1976 The Asian Institute of Tourism was formally confirmed by the University of the Philippines Board of Regents as a degree-granting unit of the University of the Philippines Diliman. As Southeast Asia’s first higher academic learning institution focusing on tourism, the UP AIT Complex was formally inaugurated on November 20, 1978. The complex had two main areas – the school side which housed classrooms and learning facilities– and the AIT House, a 27-room hotel.</p>
          <br/>
        <p class ="pangjustify pangindent">The hotel ceased operations in 1994 which paved the way for AIT to focus on the demands of tourism research, technical assistance, and other extension services all over the country. Through the years, AIT has been praised for developing knowledge, helping build capacity, and designing programs that are innovative and truly revolutionary.</p>
